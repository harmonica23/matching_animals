# Matching Animals
### By: Erica Harmon

Welcome to this simple yet brain stimulating game developed to challenge the player's memory to recall matching pairs of cards. </br>This game is fun for all ages!
***
### **_Getting Started_**
To play the game, follow these easy steps:
1. Click a card on the board to reveal an animal.
2. Click a second card on the board to reveal another animal.
3. If the two cards match, the winning pair will remain open.
4. If the cards do not match, they will be flipped back over.
5. The game continues until all cards are matched. 
6. At the end of the game, there is an option to play again.
